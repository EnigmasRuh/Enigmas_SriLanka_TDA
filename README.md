<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

The Sri Lanka Tourist Development Authority website is a government-level solution aimed at revolutionizing Sri Lanka's tourism industry. As a country rich in cultural heritage, natural beauty, and historical significance, Sri Lanka has the potential to become a global tourism hub. This project is designed to harness modern technology and artificial intelligence to propel the nation's tourism sector to new heights.

The website offers a platform for local travel services to register and create diverse packages that cater to various tourist interests. Foreign travelers can easily access, view, and select from these packages, ensuring a seamless and personalized experience.

A key feature of this solution is the streamlined visa processing system, which simplifies and digitizes the entire process. From visa form submission to risk assessment using publicly available Interpol Notices APIs, the system is designed to enhance efficiency, security, and transparency. Visa officers can easily manage applications, approve or deny them based on comprehensive data, and notify users of their visa status via email. Additionally, the system provides valuable insights to government authorities through visualized historical data and analytics, enabling informed decision-making and continuous improvement in the visa processing workflow.
